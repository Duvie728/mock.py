The user should see the current date and time after they log in
2. When the user selects option 1, they should be presented with the following:
- How much would you like to withdraw (receive input from the user), output "take your cash"
3. When the user selects option 2, present them with the following options:
- How much would you like to deposit? (receive input from the user), output current balance.
4. When the user selects complaint, present them with the following options:
- What issue will you like to report? (Receive input from the user), output "Thank you for contacting us"


Create a variable called balance and give it a value.
For current balance, you can do this
CurrentBalance = deposit + balance.
I hope this helps.
